## Entry Management Application

This is my submission for innovacor SDE Intern assignment.
This is a simple Entry Management Application which you can use to keep track of the entries of the guest in your office.

There are two types of users. Host (someone who is hosting a meeting) and guest (someone who goes to the meeting).

### Host

-   You have to register yourself in the application.
-   After you register, guests would be able to see you as one of the registered host and can select you while checking in.
-   You can see all the guests that have checked in and out after logging into account.
-   Email and message notification is also triggered when a guest checks in, therefore please enter valid email and phone number.

### Guest

-   Unlike host, you don't have to register in the application.
-   For checking in, just fill a simple form and select from the dropdown the host that you are visiting. Keeping in mind the real world scenario where you can checkin with more that one hosts at once(when you
    will have 3 meetings in the same company, for example), the application will not stop you to checkin with other host also.
-   For checkout out, you have enter your email and select the host that you checked in with.
-   Just like in the real world as long as you don't checkout with a host, you cannot checkin again.
-   When you will checkout, a message and mail will be sent to you with the details of your visit, therefore please enter a valid email and phone number.
